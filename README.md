# SYSTEM DESCRIPTION:

The owner of the local restaurant wants to make an online application for online food ordering where customers can make an order for the food and can pick up the order later. The owner would like to manage the customer details, items that the customer orders, and the information related to the payment made by the customers.

While making the order, customers should have options to choose from vegetarian items or non-vegeterian items, or even both items. The order made by the customer needs to be confirmed by any of the staff members. There should be also the tracking of the elements from which vegetarian items and non-vegeterian items are being prepared.

Another thing that owner wants is there should be one admin who can keep the record of all the staff members, and also can modify the details as per the requirements.
